# Contribution Guidelines

## General Information

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project!

**Who we are:**  
We are an amateur rocketry club based in Giessen, Hessen, Germany, primarily composed of students from THM and JLU. Our team is one of several within the club, and we focus specifically on telemetry data transfer to and from our rockets.

**Open-Source Hardware License:**  
All hardware designs, firmware, and related materials in this repository are released under the [CERN Open Hardware Licence Version 2 - Strongly Reciprocal (OHL-S v2)](LICENSE). By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be released under this license.

**Potential Challenges:**  
Since we are part of a larger club with multiple teams, changes made to this repository may affect other teams. Please coordinate any major hardware or firmware changes with the maintainers to ensure compatibility and safety.



## Ways to Contribute

### Hardware, Firmware, and Software Contributions
Contributions can include:
- Hardware improvements (antenna design, electronics, PCB layout)
- Firmware improvements (C++ code for our electronics based on AVR DB microcontrollers)
- Ground station software improvements (Python code for telemetry serial interface)

**Requirements for Contributions:**
- Hardware designs should be in **open formats** (KiCAD, SVG, STEP) whenever possible.
- Firmware and software contributions should follow common coding guidelines and be thoroughly tested and documented.
- All hardware contributions must be verified for **safety and reproducibility** by the maintainers.

### Documentation
We welcome contributions to documentation! This follows the standard GitHub issue/pull request workflow. Clear documentation is critical for reproducibility and OSHWA certification.

### Feature Requests / Bug Reports
Please open an [issue](https://github.com/Spaceflight-Rocketry-Giessen-e-V/Telemetry/issues) and tag the targeted component (software, hardware, firmware) using the issue labels.

### Pull Requests
- All pull requests must be reviewed and approved by at least one project maintainer.
- Pull requests should include sufficient testing and documentation to ensure reproducibility.



## Safety and Coordination
Since this project involves hardware for rockets, safety is important. No contribution can be merged without approval from a maintainer who has verified the design and ensures it complies with safety standards and local regulations.  
All contributors must coordinate with the maintainers to avoid conflicts with other teams’ designs.
